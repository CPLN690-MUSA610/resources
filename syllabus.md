## Course outline
Throughout this 14 week course, you'll be learning to program
applications using HTML, CSS, and javascript. In addition to programming
skills, we will stress the 'tools of the trade': you will use a
text editor designed for programming; your code will be turned in
with git and managed through github.  

We'd like to keep the course somewhat freeform - there are basic skills
to touch on in the first half of the class, but we expect your interests
to help shape the direction in the second half. There
will be a somewhat large final assignment. Its exact shape will depend
on the direction we end up taking the course.  

This portion of the syllabus is a living document - as the course
progresses, greater detail will be added to reflect the content of each
week.

### Grading scale
| Grade | Score  | Grade | Score | Grade | Score |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| A+    | 97–100 | B+    | 87–89 | C+    | 77–79 |
| A     | 93–96  | B     | 83–86 | C     | 73–76 |
| A-    | 90-92  | B-    | 80–82 | C-    | 70–72 |

* Assessment Method / Grading Criteria:
    * Participation and Attendance: 35%
    * Homework: 25%
    * Midterm Project: 15%
    * Final Project Proposal: 5%
    * Final Project:  20%

### Weekly repositories
Each week will have a different repository with the seed for that week's
assignment. Turning an assignment in will consist of editing the
template project provided as a part of each week's repo and uploading
your changes to github. Assignments are due (on github) on Sunday
at midnight.

### Midterm project
We will provide a menu of appropriate features for an application to be
programmed midway through the course (in a lab and at home with a
completely open book). The subject matter of this assignment will be the
basics of open source, online mapping applications.

### Final project
The final assignment for the class will be decided through a project
proposal. Final projects will be done in groups or independently -
criteria for success will be hammered out in the final project proposal
and group projects will, of course, be expected to engage with a wider
scope and greater difficulty than individual projects. Group projects
will also leverage the power of github to make collaboration simpler and
more transparent for grading purposes (this will make more sense when
you're familiar with github).

### Academic Integrity
In compliance (and agreement) with Penn's [Code of Academic Integrity](http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/ai_codeofacademicintegrity.html), blatantly copying another student's work will not be tolerated. However, because this course is designed to help prepare students for working in a professional programming environments, copying and pasting is not universally prohibited: we encourage students to freely use the internet as a resource for finding code. Citing every copied and pasted line of code is *not* necessary. Large patterns or multiple lines of code taken from external sources *should*, however, be noted with in-code comments. If an instance is unclear, you should feel free to speak with the instructors.
