### Academic Integrity
In compliance (and agreement) with Penn's [Code of Academic Integrity](http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/ai_codeofacademicintegrity.html), blatantly copying another student's work will not be tolerated. However, because this course is designed to help prepare students for working in a professional programming environments, copying and pasting is not universally prohibited: we encourage students to freely use the internet as a resource for finding code. Citing every copied and pasted line of code is *not* expected — nor would it be desirable.  
Discussing assignments on the class [chat room](https://gitter.im/CPLN690-MUSA610/syllabus) and working collaboratively to complete assignments is acceptable. Copying and pasting another student's completed work to avoid mental exertion is both unacceptable and foolish: if you have better things to do, *do those things instead*.
